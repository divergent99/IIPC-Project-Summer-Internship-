# IIPC-Project-Summer-Internship-
PROJECT OVERVIEW

After downloading the datasets from Kaggle, we decided to implement 3 main regression algorithms to predict the fatalities in this diabolical pandemic.

1.Linear Regression Model
lm([target variable] ~ [predictor variables], data = [data source])


2.Support Vector Regression
#Regression with SVM
modelsvm = svm(Y~X,data)



3.Random Forests
randomForest(formula, data)

The goal was to determine the best suitable algorithm for predicting the total number of deaths.
